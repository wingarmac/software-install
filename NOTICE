I'm working on a script in sh for reinstallation purposes of my desktop environment with exactly the same packages I currently use.

**First problem:**

This is the command I use to reinstall the packages on a clean install for now ([file on Github][1]).

"**Install software list**" option actually in my script:

    for pkg in `cat installation.txt`; do sudo apt-get install -y $pkg; done;

I would like to optimize it by adding an option to export "**Export software list**" with a better package list, containing only the required elements to reinstall it the way it was before.

I tried the command `apt-mark showmanual` to create the installation.txt file, but ...

 - The problem here is that **it should not contain the dependent packages** that are installed with each. It should only contain the master packages. 

 - This search **should also exclude packages from 3th party sources** like
   Chrome or Webmin. Since those are installed with `wget` and `dpkg -i`
   commands in my case.
 - It **should also exclude package from sources that aren't from official Ubuntu repos**/additional PPA sources. 

    I tried to apply like suggested by @user535733 :

    `wget -O - http://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/jammy/ubuntu-22.04.1-live-server-amd64.manifest | awk '{print $1}' > manifest`

    This output shows a list of the default packages installed of the release I use.

    `apt-mark showmanual > listmanual`

    `comm -2 -3 listmanual manifest`

    Output a list containing also libraries and other dependency packages. It also gives these messages:
    
    `comm: file 2 is not in sorted order`

    `comm: input is not in sorted order`

 - It should also exclude de graphic driver/other proprietary drivers

**Second problem:**

I would like to create a marked package list to prevent the installation of software I do not use. Like vim, vlc or libre-office* since `--no-install-recommends` also  prevents the installation of packages I want to be installed.

I found this could be done with `sudo apt-mark hold <VARIABLE>`

So I would like to export a list that contains all software that has been purged until now and mark them before reinstallation. I probably will have to purge some instead of marking since these are installed with the system installation of Ubuntu server, like Vim. Since I use nano (in terminal) and gedit (in GUI).

This should prevent the installation of packages I had to purge after installation of my desktop environment.


**To resume, I need to export 3 variables:**
 1. List of packages I need to reinstall 
    
    **Without libraries and other dependencies - Without unofficial sources - Without proprietary drivers** > Needs to be exported to installation.txt
 2. List of packages I need to mark to prevent their installation
 3. List of packages I need to purge after the base system installation

    **Examples for point 2 and 3: <hr/>in my specific case** : Libre-office*, Firefox, Byobu, Vim, ...<hr/>For packages installed with Ubuntu server > I need to export to purge.txt<hr/>For those I do not want to be installed with the Cinnamon Desktop environment > I need to export to mark.txt

I recently found a way to get a list with only packages installed with `apt install` and removed manually  with "apt purge":

`cat /var/log/apt/history.log | grep "apt install"`

    Commandline: apt install aptitude
    Commandline: apt install slick-greeter muffin cinnamon
    Commandline: apt install nvidia-driver-525
    Commandline: apt install gnome-terminal gnome-system-tools gnome-disk-utility gparted gnome-system-monitor psensor
    Commandline: apt install -f
    Commandline: apt install fonts-symbola
    Commandline: apt install yaru-theme-icon
    Commandline: apt install --install-recommends winehq-devel
    Commandline: apt install subversion
    Commandline: apt install -f
    Commandline: apt install gir1.2-gtop-2.0 gir1.2-nm-1.0 gir1.2-clutter-1.0 gnome-system-monitor
    Commandline: apt install sysstat
    Commandline: apt install ntpdate
    Commandline: apt install easy-rsa
    Commandline: apt install gnome-shell-extension-manager
    Commandline: apt install mintinstall
    Commandline: apt install mintupdate
    Commandline: apt install --reinstall mintsources

Some lines contain unwanted data to export. Like `apt install -f` and `apt install --reinstall mintsources` shouldn't be exported.

At top of that, I should also filter the packages that aren't on Ubuntu sources (like [wine-devel][2], [mintinstall and mintupdate][3]) and proprietary drivers (like the Nvidia driver or on some of my installations my Brother printer driver). The rest of the output seems good to me. 

`cat /var/log/apt/history.log | grep purge`

    Commandline: apt-get purge -y lxd-installer
    Commandline: apt purge ubuntu-session
    Commandline: apt purge gnome-calc*
    Commandline: apt purge subversion
    Commandline: apt purge byobu
    Commandline: apt purge vim

I only use `apt`, not `apt-get` to install packages. In opposite, the system uses allways `apt-get` like I can see in /var/log/apt/history.log

This makes it more convenient for me. So, instead of searching for `purge`, I should use `apt purge`, to restrict the search to what I've entered.

Even for the apt install output, I've no libraries, no dependencies, no deb packages from other sources. I think I'm near a solution, if it isn't for proprietary drivers I've also installed with `apt install`.

I need to remove all text that is not a package inside the output file, to restrict it to a package list.

For point 3, I wonder if marking a package will make the system request a purge of the package already installed?

export apt install packages options: 

awk -F'll ' '
  /apt install/ && !/nvidia/ && !/--/ && !/-f/{ print $2 }
' /var/log/apt/history.log >installation.txt


sed -e '/^Commandline: apt install /!d' -e 's///' \
    -e '/nvidia/d' -e '/--/d' -e '/-f/d' \
    </var/log/apt/history.log >installation.txt
    
  
How to add in sh script is the next step?
